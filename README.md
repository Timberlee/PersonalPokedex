Notes to self:

Pokeballs might: bounce, rubberband
Spin, deaccelerate up/accel down like a throw when actually clicked, since that would be obnoxious for hover.

the pokeball animaitons in game are what i'd call a whirl -accel and decel spin,  bounce, and throw up/fall down. Plus roll (and twitch) but I'm less concerned about in-game ones.

Relative vs absolute grid to position pokeballs?










For later:
It would be slick to dynamically fill the border grid items a) randomly with images b) Maybe images from the API but download separately (Even with 4 images x3 pokemon... that's a lot) c) to use the mechanics from a snake video game. That would be the ultimate conga line.
